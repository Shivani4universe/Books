Book: the girl who loved tom gordon by Tom Gordon

What I felt: I didn't know that even without using imaginary ghosts or other typical horror scenarios, this book has used natural and very realistic situation. Like what will happen if I were to get lost in a wood. I knew that she was never going go get out of the woods. But she was so brave, and I cried so much in the end like I never had ðŸ¥º
